  "description": "The EcoYield-SAFE model is a daily time step spreadsheet-based biophysical model of tree, crop, and grass yields.  It is based on the Yield-SAFE model originally developed in the EU SAFE (Silvoarable Agroforestry for Europe) project (2001-2005) and described by van der Werf et al. (2007).\n\nThe principal addition in the EcoYield-SAFE model, compared to Yield-SAFE. is the inclusion of a soil carbon model based on Rothamsted Carbon model (RothC) described by Coleman and Jenkinson (2014).  The model also includes additional algorithms so that crop water use responds to the daily vapour pressure deficit These changes were undertaken during the EU AGFORWARD project (Grant number 613520). \n\nThis link provides access to EcoYield-SAFE v2 which has recently been used to determine the effect of climate change on tree and crop yields (Giannitsopoulos et al., 2025).  Version 2 includes the effect of increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide on the radiation use efficiency of the trees, grass, and crops. These changes were undertaken during the EU AGROMIX project (Grant agreement 862993).\n\nGiannitsopoulos, M.L., Burgess, P.J., Graves, A.R., Olave, R.J., Eden, J.M., Herzog, F. (2025).
