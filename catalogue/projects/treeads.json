	"description": "Wildfires are unplanned and usually rage uncontrolled. Managing these fires is also a societal and ecological challenge. The EU-funded TREEADS project will focus on the forests at risk of wildfire to develop new products and integrate them in a holistic Fire Management platform aimed at optimising and reusing the existing socio-technological resources. The project proposes the use of a real-time risk assessment tool that can receive multiple classification inputs and works with an innovative neutral network-powered risk factor indicator. TREEADS will use alkali-activated construction materials integrating post-wildfire wood ashes to create a model of fire-adapted communities and use advanced techniques empowered by AI and diverse toolsets for prevention and preparedness",
