	"description": "The project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the current state, challenges, and potential of agroforestry systems in Lower Saxony. It seeks to systematically evaluate and document these aspects and to address existing obstacles in a solution-oriented manner. For this purpose, five partner farms with alley cropping systems will be studied. These include systems focused on the production of woody biomass (primarily poplars), systems aimed at food and/or high-value timber production (e.g. with walnut, chestnut, pome and stone fruit trees), as well as farms that combine both approaches. The analysis will cover economic, social, and agronomic dimensions. Particular attention will be given to the contribution of agroforestry systems to plant health, food safety, and optimized nutrient management.",
