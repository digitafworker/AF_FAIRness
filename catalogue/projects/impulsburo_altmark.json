	"description": "Aufbau eines Agroforst-Impulsb\u00fcros in der Altmark, Sachsen-Anhalt\n\nThe German Association for Agroforestry (DeFAF e.V.) is setting up an impulse office for the rural region \"Altmark\" in cooperation with the ecovillage Sieben Linden. The Altmark is located in the north of Saxony-Anhalt and is strongly agricultural. The region, which is generally rather low in precipitation, has suffered from the consequences of increasing drought and heat in recent years.\n\nThe overarching goal is to support the implementation of agroforestry systems in and around the Altmark region, to make agroforestry known as a sustainable solution in agriculture and to promote education and networking in this field. Parts of our project work are the planning and implementation of one or two agroforestry model areas as reference examples, education and networking events, and support for farmers in decision-making.",
