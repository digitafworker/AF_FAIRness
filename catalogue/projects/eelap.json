  "description": "The EELAP project will create and extend multi stakeholder living labs in five EU countries (DE, HU, SL, SK, IE) and includes policy and modelling input from FR and CH. Living labs will be in regions characterised by arable (crop production) or grassland (livestock production), at different spatial scales and with different types of local and regional governance structures. EELAP will promote the transition to agroecology, focusing on long-term practices such as agroforestry. It will close knowledge gaps and explore how agroecology can be integrated in the cultural landscape through spatial planning and management. Innovative solutions will be explored through biophysical modelling focused on farms in living labs.",
