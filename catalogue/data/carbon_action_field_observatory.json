  "description": "Carbon Action farms, other farms, and study sites produce data on the impacts of land management on carbon sequestration and ecosystem functioning. Scientists use these data to develop improved management practices and better models to estimate the results and their longevity. On each Carbon Action farm, a tailored carbon farming method is tested on a 1,5 ha plot while a neighboring 1,5 ha plot serves as a business-as-usual reference. Each technique is tested on several farms because the outcome depends on many factors, such as the farmer, soil, and location. The project shows 20 so-called Advanced Carbon Action farms of the 105 Carbon Action farms in Field Observatory. They also show other study sites on agricultural land, forest, and urban green space in Field Observatory. The project has collected soil samples from each Advanced Carbon Action Site annually since 2019 and taken laboratory measurements of these samples. They use these data to track changes in soil organic matter, microbes, nutrients, and physical properties. In addition,  The project has observed soil structure and vegetation characteristics in the field to supplement the laboratory analyses. All data can be explored in the online observatory as well as downloaded from the Zenodo repository.",
