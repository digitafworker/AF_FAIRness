  "description": "iSDAsoil provides farmers and scientists alike with insights into soil properties and nutrients mapped at 30 m spatial resolution for two standard depth intervals (0\u201320 cm and 20\u201350 cm). This fine resolution service can effectively capture the variation observable at a local or field level and thus, information, analysis, and advice drawn from it can greatly assist in closing knowledge gaps about local soil composition. Farmers will now know the distribution of soil pH levels in their plots for instance which in turn will inform them whether the land can host only a limited range of either acidity-liking or lime-loving plants respectively, or whether more neutral pH values allow for a greater variety of crops to be grown. Aside from soil pH, iSDAsoil also provides variables for organic carbon (C) and total (organic) nitrogen (N), total carbon, extractable \u2014 phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), silt, clay and sand, bulk density and depth to bedrock. Composition predictions were generated using two-scale Ensemble Machine Learning, a combination of Sentinel-2, Landsat, DEM derivatives and coarse resolution covariates (MODIS, PROBA-V), and over 100,000 soil sampling training points. In other words, multiple machine learning algorithms were employed together with analysis of a host of high resolution satellite images and variables stemming from 100,000 soil field samples to enhance the accuracy and precision of soil data predictions.",
