  "tool_project_name": "The development of the software ShadeMotion has been a long term project that has only been possible  thanks to the sustained support of CATIE and several donors and projects. The transition of static  simulations in version 3 to dynamic simulations in ShadeMotion 4.0 with the sponsorship of the Research  Consortium in Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA) of CGIAR and the project EC-LEDS II (Enhancing  Capacity for Low Emissions Development Strategies) of CATIE/USDA was particularly relevant for  ShadeMotion. The progress to version 5 brought along a fundamental change in the language and in  the programming code that allowed for a drastic reduction in the duration of simulations and, hence,  the possibility to use the software in participatory agroforestry design workshops with producers.  ShadeMotion 5.0 was developed with the financial support of the Heifer/CATIE Chocolate4All project. Development of current version 5.1.41 was supported by the Research Consortium in Forests, Trees  and Agroforestry (FTA) from the CGIAR.",
