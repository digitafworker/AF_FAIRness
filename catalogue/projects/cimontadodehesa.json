Joint methodologies for diagnosing the cork oak forests, action plans, as well as methodologies for applying good practices, and, finally, visual and scientific assessment of the environmental impacts of the practices implemented, will also be developed in 13 pilot areas in Portugal and Spain (520 hectares).", "keywords": ["Dehesa", "montado", "sustainability", "restoration", "connectivity"], "contact": "https://andanatura.org/", "start_date": "02/01/2023", "end_date": "30/06/2026", "id": "cimontadodehesa", "timestamp_creation": 1741780060763, "timestamp_lastedit": 1741780060763}
