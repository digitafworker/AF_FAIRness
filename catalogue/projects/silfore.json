	"description": "The general objective of LIFE SILFORE is to increase the resilience of Atlantic and sub-Atlantic agroforestry systems to climate change, with strategies linked to the multifunctional use of the territory and the promotion of functional (specific) and landscape biodiversity. This will be carried out by combining different silvopastoral management and pasture habitats managed at the agroforestry exploitation level, as an opportunity for their diversification and profitability. The strategies will be implemented both in publicly and privately owned territories, increasing their impact and future replication.",
