  "description": "The Cool Farm Tool is free for farmers with five product footprints available before a fee is required. Organisations that use the CFT to support sustainable agriculture (a wide range of food supply chain participants) pay to become members of the ‘Cool Farm Alliance’. \n\nThe tool can be used for product level greenhouse gas assessments and farm level biodiversity impact assessments.\n\nCool Farm Tool applies a detailed method for calculation of soil GHG emissions and goes beyond the IPCC Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods, including indirect and direct nitrous oxide emissions, embedded emissions form mineral fertilisers and changes in soil carbon stock. The soil emissions are affected by factors such as application rate, fertiliser type, crop type and soil properties.\n\nThe results can be used to inform farm management options, environmental performance, and allows farmers to track and measure improvements over time.",
