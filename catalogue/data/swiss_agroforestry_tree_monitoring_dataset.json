  "description": "The dataset consists of tree measurements from four agroforestry plots in Switzerland with about 150 individual trees, which were measured every three years from planting (2006, 2007, 2010, 2013) until 2024. The data include tree species (poplar, cherry, apple), year of planting, number of trees in the whole system, tree density per hectare, age at measurement, field coordinates, DBH and tree height.\nThe published data were generated in the framework of Roberti et al. 2025, parts of the project and co-authors were funded by Agroscope, Agridea and ZHAW in the framework of the Swiss Baumg\u00e4rten project of the MAVA Foundation, the AGFORWARD project (European Commission 7th Framework Programme, Grant 613520) and the AGROMIX project (European Union's Horizon 2020, Grant Agreement 862993).",
