	"description": "The Climate landscape Wolfenb\u00fcttel project is creating a climate-resilient, sustainable agricultural landscape through innovative agroforestry systems. Together with farmers, local authorities and citizens, we are developing networked woodland structures that promote biodiversity, store water and protect the soil. The result is a model for sustainable land use that serves as a blueprint for other regions. With targeted planning, participatory design and scientific support, we focus on practical solutions that combine ecological benefits with economic opportunities.",
