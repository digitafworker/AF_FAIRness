	"description": "Forest ecosystems are exposed to multiple forestry-internal as well as external pressures, i.e. climate change. Sustainable, transformative changes are needed to improve the condition of forest ecosystems and minimise risks. In that direction, the EU-funded SUPERB project will create lasting transformative change towards large-scale forest and forest landscape restoration. The project will inform decisions for the restoration of biodiversity, ecosystem services and carbon sequestration to maximise synergies between ecosystem services. SUPERB will conduct 12 large-scale demonstrations to showcase best practices in forest restoration. It will also develop a multi-language, online Forest Ecosystem Restoration Gateway to provide practical, economic and governance supporting materials and best practice examples for high-quality restoration",
