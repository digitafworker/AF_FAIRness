	"description": "The EU-funded FIRE-ADAPT project will connect expertise from across regions from the Mediterranean Basin and Latin America to improve understanding of integrated fire managementâ€™s role in wildfire management and improvement of natural and cultural ecosystem services. More particularly, FIRE-ADAPT will quantify, monitor and evaluate the impact of integrated fire management on carbon dynamics, biodiversity and ecosystem cultural services in different tropical and subtropical regions with fires whose characteristics have been changing over the last decades. The project will deploy six Study Hubs in Mediterranean countries (Spain, France, Italy) and Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina) to promote science-practitioner exchanges, collaborations and networking",
