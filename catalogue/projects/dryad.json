Droughts, wildfires, and high tree mortality pose severe risks to these landscapes. Addressing these challenges requires local solutions and transformative approaches to build climate resilience. Local communities and authorities need support to adapt effectively. In this context, the EU-funded DRYAD project aims to tackle these issues by developing and implementing climate-resilient, nature-based solutions (NBS). Focusing on regions such as Andalusia, Alentejo, and Sardinia, DRYAD will test innovative NBS, later transferring successful solutions to additional regions. By engaging local authorities, stakeholders, and citizens through Living Labs, DRYAD seeks to create sustainable, adaptable practices.", "keywords": ["Multirisk", "integrated ecohydrological model", "LoRaWan real-time monitoring", "climate resilience", "NBS"], "lead": "Universidade da Coru\u00f1a", "contact": "info@dryad-project.eu", "project_url": "https://dryad-project.eu/", "project_funding_programme_listing": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101156076", "start_date": "01/09/2024", "end_date": "31/08/2028", "id": "dryad", "timestamp_creation": 1739285869193, "timestamp_lastedit": 1739285869193}
