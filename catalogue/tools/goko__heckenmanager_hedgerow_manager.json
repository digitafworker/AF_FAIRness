	"description": "The Go\u00d6ko Hedgerow Manager (German: Heckenmanager) is a decision-support tool for the management and planning of hedges in agricultural areas, taking sustainability aspects into account. In addition to a step-by-step guide, the application is linked to a separate woody plant database. The hedge manager can be used free of charge on the DeFAF website.\n\nFor the hedgerow ecosystem services assessment, a hedgerow structure index was developed based on literature data. It was proposed for the evaluation of hedgerow quality in relation to agrobiodiversity. This index takes into account the following characteristics of hedgerows structural diversity that are important for biodiversity: i) hedgerow width, ii) hedgerow structure, iii) hedgerow height, iv) tree diameter, v) species diversity, vi) food source, vii) hedgerow continuity and viii) hedgerow density. In general, the higher the structural diversity of hedgerows the higher their potential value as a habitat and food source for a variety of species.\n\nOnce the target area has been selected, hedges can be managed, transformed or entirely replanted. A feature that can be used for planning diverse agroforestry systems. The ecosystem services are evaluated in relation to the status quo. Finally, a pdf is generated that covers all previously defined planning aspects, including a planting plan and order lists for obtaining quotations, handing in to the authorities or request for funding. \n\nThe hedge manager was developed between 2019 and 2021.
