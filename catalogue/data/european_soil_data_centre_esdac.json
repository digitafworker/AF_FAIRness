  "description": "The European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) is the thematic centre for soil related data in Europe. Its ambition is to be the single reference point for and to host all relevant soil data and information at European level. It contains a number of resources that are organized and presented in various ways: datasets, services/applications, maps, documents, events, projects and external links. The European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) contains currently many soil data and information. Most of the offered data are at European scale, while, when possible, links to national or global datasets are provided. \n\nDatasets are organized in some broad categories. A first category contains the European Soil Database (ESDB), datasets that have been derived with the help of the ESDB and general European datasets that contain soil properties. A second category offers data that are related to soil threats (erosion, soil organic carbon, landslides, compaction, salinization, soil biodiversity, contaminated sites, soil sealing, etc.). A third category offers data related to soil functions. A fourth category offers soil point data (LUCAS, SPADE, etc). A fifth category contains data that stem from projects. Some datasets can be freely downloaded; others will be made accessible after prior registration, through a fill-in form.",

Raising awereness is the main aim of this series of soil atlases, which describes the differences in soil patterns in different parts of the world in an easily understandable language, combined with beautiful illustrations and diagrams. ESDAC has published six atlases between 2005 - 2023. They are the result of fruitful collaborations with researchers and institutes worldwide. Data coming from different countries and sources were processed to produce harmonised maps which indicate solutions for sustainable management of soils and provide the ground to build strong collaborations worldwide.",
