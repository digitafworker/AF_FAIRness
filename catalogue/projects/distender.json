	"description": "DISTENDER will build a methodological framework to guide the integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in Europe. It will use participatory approaches which respond to the impacts and risks of climate change, linked to quantitative and qualitative analyses of the interactions, synergies and trade-offs. These approaches will focus on six core case studies (Austria, Dehesa-Montado in Iberia, Torino, Groeningen, Gedansk, Guimares) and five “follower” cities. The project will develop a set of multi-driver qualitative and quantitative socio-economic-climate scenarios, using a participatory process that integrates bottom-up knowledge and local pressures with top-down information from the global European Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and downscaled IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). A cross-sectorial and multi-scale impact assessment modelling toolkit will be developed to analyse complex interactions over multiple sectors, including an economic evaluation framework. Economic analysis will take place on the impact of the different climate impacts: including insurance damage claims and sectoral activity patterns which consider indirect and cascading effects. DISTENDER will combine three key concepts: a) evaluation at multiple scales, b) model integration & harmonisation and c) robustness checking. It will follow a pragmatic approach which applies methodologies and toolkits across case studies reflecting a cross-section of the challenges posed by climate adaptation and mitigation. The knowledge generated by DISTENDER will be synthesised in a Decision Support System (DSS) which will include guidelines, manuals, easy-to-use tools and experiences from the cases studies",
