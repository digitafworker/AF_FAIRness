The approach divides the agroforestry system into different functional zones each containing maximally one crop and on tree. These zones are simulated indepentently. The approach is model independent and could be applied to any agroecosystem model that is capable of simulateneously simulating at least one tree and one crop component.", "logo_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-024-01127-y/figures/1", "keywords": ["Agroecosystem model", "DayCent", "simulation", "ex-ante assessment"], "developers": "Moritz Laub, Ulysse Le Goff, Marc Pr\u00e9bandier, Johan Six, R\u00e9mi Cardinael", "organizations": "ETH Zurich, CIRAD", "contact": "moritz.laub@usys.ethz.ch", "tool_project": "Yes", "tool_project_name": "LANDMARC", "tool_project_url": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/869367", "status": "Implemented", "license": "Creative Commons BY", "license_url": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "year_release": 2025, "year_lastupdate": 2025, "previous_versions_available": "Only one version exists", "url_persistent": "Yes", "access_barrier": "Access to the tool needs to be granted (e.g. tool owner needs to give permission after user registration; tool owner sends tool after receiving a request email)", "access_procedure": "The approach is free to use and the equations given in the manuscript.
