	"description": "Mediterranean forests are a lifeline for local economies, offering a wealth of ecosystem services and goods. However, the sector is grappling with numerous challenges, including slow-growing timber profitability, limited markets for non-wood forest products (NWFPs), and the complex interplay of an ageing rural population, farmland abandonment and encroaching scrublands. There is also the threat of megafires, exacerbated by climate change. In this context, the EU-funded INCREdible project aims to close the research and innovation gap by fostering collaboration between practitioners and scientists, as well as among different regions. It will focus on key NWFPs such as cork, resins, aromatics and edibles. These will serve as hubs for gathering best practices related to production, transformation and trade channels",
