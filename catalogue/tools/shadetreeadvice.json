A the tool's core is a method to gather and consolidate the local ecological knowledge of farmers who are already managing agroforestry systems. This process leads to a database of tree species and their effectiveness in providing various local services (e.g., soil fertility, weather protection, and supplemental revenue). Farmers seeking to introduce trees onto their farms can specify the services they prioritize, and the tool will rank tree species that offer the best trade-offs, based on the knowledge shared by other local farmers. To date, ShadeTreeAdvice supports tree species selection for coffee and cocoa farms in over 10 locations across the tropical belt.", "keywords": ["Tree selection", "Agroforestry", "Coffee and cocoa", "Farmer knowledge"], "developers": "", "organizations": "CIRAD", "contact": "Clement Rigal - clement.rigal@cirad.fr", "tool_project": "No, it has another source", "status": "Implemented", "license": "Not stated", "year_release": 2016, "year_lastupdate": 2021, "previous_versions_available": "No", "indicators_other": "Food provision, Timber, Firewood provision, Mulch, Climate regulation, pro", "url_persistent": "No", "access_barrier": "No, direct download/access through a web link", "listed_other_databases": "Don't know", "integrated_other_tools": "No", "documentation_available": "Yes", "documentation_accessible": "Some of it", "documentation_theoretical_background_list": "The map on https://www.shadetreeadvice.org/ lists the studies and links to the documents", "data_provenance": "Yes", "development_process": "No", "training_materials": "No", "documentation_contribute": "Yes", "digitaf_tool": "Yes", "documentation_theoretical_background": "Yes", "id": "shadetreeadvice", "timestamp_creation": 1741633920426, "timestamp_lastedit": 1741633920426}
