The aim of the project is to close the existing knowledge gaps on climateresilient tree species/varieties and practicable planting qualities through field experiments. The studies should help to gain insights into the successful establishment of trees with lasting plant health and regular growth, thereby minimizing replanting in agroforestry systems. The results should be made available to experts and practitioners in land management and thus enable a \u201crisk-minimized\u201d, successful establishment of agroforestry systems in the future.", "keywords": ["agroforestry", "alley cropping", "climate-resilience", "successful establishment of trees in dry regions", "field trials", "planting quality", "air-pruning"], "lead": "Hochschule f\u00fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung Eberswalde", "contact": "leonie.steinherr@hnee.de, ralf.bloch@hnee.de , tobias.cremer@hnee.de", "project_url": "https://www.hnee.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte/klimagrargehoelze", "start_date": "01/03/2025", "end_date": "28/02/2028", "id": "klimagrargehlze", "timestamp_creation": 1746705544029, "timestamp_lastedit": 1746705544029}
