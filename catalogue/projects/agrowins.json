To this end, existing barriers are systematically analyzed, solution-oriented approaches are developed, and the results are prepared and shared through targeted knowledge transfer and dialogue. A central element of the project is the exchange between farmers, agricultural associations, nature conservation authorities, ministries, and municipalities, with the goal of fostering long-term synergies for sustainable land management. As part of the project, a regional potential analysis will be carried out to identify and visualize the suitability of agroforestry systems across Lower Saxony. To support knowledge transfer, a series of film tutorials will also be produced, offering practical guidance and insights for the implementation of agroforestry systems.", "keywords": ["knowledge transfer", "agroforestry", "Lower Saxony", "dialogue", "potential analysis", "film tutorials"], "lead": "Lower Saxony Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection", "project_url": "https://agroforst-info.de/agrowins/", "start_date": "01.12.2024", "end_date": "31.12.2025", "id": "agrowins", "timestamp_creation": 1742977342647, "timestamp_lastedit": 1742977342647}
