	"description": "The aim of the LIFE ShepForBio project is to improve the conservation status of three habitat types listed in the Habitats Directive \u2018Semi-natural dry grasslands\u2026\u2019 (6210*), \u2018Species-rich Nardus grasslands\u2026\u2019 (6230*) and \u2018Juniperus communis formations on heaths or calcareous grasslands\u2019 (5130), in the National Park of the Casentinesi Forests, through the development of pastoral activities that will guarantee their sustainable and lasting management. The approach is based on three lines of action: (i) habitat restoration through direct management (e.g. shrub clearing); (ii) supporting existing pastoral activities through the economical recognition of the multi-services that mountain farms provide (e.g. landscape and biodiversity conservation, production of food) and training courses based on shepherd needs; and (iii) increased recruitment of new shepherds.",
