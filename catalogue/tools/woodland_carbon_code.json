  "description": "The woodland Carbon Code is a quality assurance standard developed by the UK Forestry Commission. The website contains a “Carbon prediction tool” for forest stand carbon assessments which can be downloaded as an excel spreadsheet. The tool is suited for the UK but could be useful for demonstration and teaching outside the UK as well.\n\nThe tool provides information on carbon sequestration in standing tree biomass and debris, carbon stock and wood removals in different management regimes.\n\nThe code is endorsed by the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance (ICROA). The code is compliant with PAS2060 – Carbon Neutrality Specification which gives guidance how verified woodland carbon units can be used in claims of carbon neutrality of an activity, product, service, building, project or event in the UK.",
