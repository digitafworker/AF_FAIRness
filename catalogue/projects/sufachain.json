  "description": "The project aims to analyse agroforestry systems and integrate them into local land use, and to develop products and technologies that contribute to sustainable resource use and local value creation. The project focusses on analysing agroforestry and plantation areas to include nut and fruit trees, developing more efficient processing technologies and higher quality food products, improving marketing channels through supply chain transparency, strengthening producer organisations and certification, and increasing local value through valorisation of ecological and social ecosystem services.",
