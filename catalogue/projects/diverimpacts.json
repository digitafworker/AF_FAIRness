	"description": "The overall goal of DiverIMPACTS - Diversification through Rotation, Intercropping, Multiple Cropping, Promoted with Actors and value-Chains towards Sustainability - was to achieve the full potential of diversification of cropping systems for improved productivity, delivery of ecosystem services and resource-efficient and sustainable value chains. DiverIMPACTS had 34 partners and was coordinated by Dr. Antoine Mess√©an of INRAE, the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. Dr. Didier Stilmant of CRA-W, Belgium, acted as deputy coordinator. The project was funded under Horizon 2020, the European Union's framework programme for research and innovation",
