Many repositories will automatically generate globally unique (i.e., someone else could not reuse/reassign the same identifier without referring to your data) and persistent (it should be kept active into the future, at least to some degree) identifiers to deposited documents, tools, or datasets. Identifiers also help others to properly, and unambiguously, cite the tool. DOI[https://www.doi.org/] are an example, automatically generated for peer-reviewed publications, some repositories (Zenodo[https://zenodo.org/], OpenAIRE[https://www.openaire.eu/]), and Github[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content] code repositories integrated into Zenodo. PURL[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator] are another example.",

That the retrieval protocols are free ensures that those lacking monetary means can equitably access the resource. That they are universally implementable ensures that the technology is available to all (and not restricted, for instance, by country or a sub-community). However, it may not be possible to provide secure access through a fully mechanised protocol, for example for highly sensitive data. There may be access restrictions based on ethical, legal, or contractual constraints, which require additional measures. In such cases, it is perfectly FAIR to provide an email, telephone number, or other means to contact the responsible person who can discuss access to the tool/data.
