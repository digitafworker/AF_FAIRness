	"description": "The Go\u00d6ko woody plant database (German: Geh\u00f6lzdatenbank) is a website to gain information on tree and shrub species typically found in the agricultural landscape in Germany. The database includes 59 tree and shrub species. The location and climate requirements, habitats of the woody plants, utilization aspects, landscape aesthetic and cultural significance as well as the indicator values according to Ellenberg are compiled in the database. The decision support tool Go\u00d6ko Hedgerow Manager (German: Heckenmanager) is based on this, for example when selecting the right tree species for a specific location.\nThe plant database can be used free of charge on the DeFAF website.",
