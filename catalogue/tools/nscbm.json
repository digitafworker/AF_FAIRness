	"description": "One of the greatest assets of (urban) green infrastructure is its multi-benefits. However, it might be very complicated to estimate what these benefits are and how they can be valued, especially in early project stages. To fill this gap for practitioners, providing an evidence base to support informed decision making the Nature Smart Cities Business Model was developed. The Nature Smart Cities business model has been designed specifically to be used in municipalities to assess the value of green infrastructure in urbanized environments. It does this by exploring the impact on ecosystem services of different spatial scenarios. That way, users get an intuitive overview of how a project influences the generation of these ecosystem services. The use of the Nature Smart Cities Business Model is especially relevant in early project stages to get a rough overview of estimated impacts. You may also gain inspiration on how your project can be optimized even further!",
