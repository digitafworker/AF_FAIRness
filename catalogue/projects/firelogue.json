	"description": "Wildfires are a growing problem across the world, as unprecedented wildfires have raged with an intensity and across geographical regions never seen before while climate change further increases their frequency and severity. Furthermore, the multitude of stakeholders – ranging from forestry and agriculture to infrastructure operators, insurance, civil society, civil protection authorities and first responders – constitutes a challenge in designing holistic policies. The EU-funded Firelogue project aims to support and coordinate the consolidation of knowledge from the wildfire risk related Green Deal Innovation Actions and the wider community. It integrates the findings across stakeholder groups and fire management, and promotes discussion via forums and workshops, leading to exchange among a large range of stakeholders",
